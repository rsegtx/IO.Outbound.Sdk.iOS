/**
 SDK Version 1.0.3
 
 Outbound sends automated email, SMS and push notifications
 based on the actions users take or do not take in your app. The Outbound API 
 has two components:
 
 Identify each of your users and their attributes using an identify API call.
 Track the actions that each user takes in your app using a track API call.
 Because every message is associated with a user (identify call) and a specific 
 trigger action that a user took or should take (track call), Outbound is able 
 to keep track of how each message affects user actions in your app. 
 These calls also allow you to target campaigns and customize each message 
 based on user data.
 
 Example: When a user in San Francisco (user attribute) does signup (event)
 but does not upload a picture (event) within 2 weeks, send them an email
 about how they'll benefit from uploading a picture.

 the "signup" event acts as a campaign trigger. If the user does not do 
 the desired goal event, "upload a picture" in 2 weeks, Outbound sends 
 your reminder message.
 
 @param properties An optional dictionary of free-form properties you want 
 to track for the event. It may contain nested fields and fields can be of any type.
 
 Example: properties can be metadata of the event. For example timestamp could be

 the "upload a picture" event.

# IO.Outbound.Sdk.iOS

This project is based on an outdated API and is no longer supported as Zendesk has elminated their free developer accounts. Feel free to use this project as a starting point should you need to build Xamarin bindings for Outbound.

The Outbound platform helps you create, automate, and optimize messaging across web, SMS,
email, and mobile push. A part of the Outbound platform are SDKs for both Android and iOS
that simplify adding robust messaging to your mobile apps. 

You can find details about use of the Android SDK on Zendesk's website:

There is also a NuGet package:
